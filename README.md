Predicting missing letters with Markov Chain (with Bayes approach for probability) and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrence Neural Network (LSTM RNN)

There are 2 Jupyter Notebook for Markov Chain and LSTM but only 1 python script for Markov Chain since we only figure out how to run keras in Jupyter Notebook
